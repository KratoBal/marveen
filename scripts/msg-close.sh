# Close an inter-agent message, and FAIL LOUDLY if the close did not happen.
#
# Why this exists, measured 2026-08-26. Closing a message is a PUT to
# /api/messages/<id>, and every caller hand-rolled it as
#
#   curl -s -X PUT ... -d '{"status":"done","result":"..."}' >/dev/null
#
# That line reports success in three situations that are not success: the token
# was rejected (401), the body was malformed JSON (400), or the id does not
# exist (404). It happened twice in one day on this install. The second time the
# result text contained an unbalanced quote, the API answered with an error, the
# response went to /dev/null, and the message stayed OPEN -- which the router
# then kept re-delivering, because an unhandled inbox starves every other
# agent's delivery.
#
# The same shape already had a fix on the sending side (agent-msg.sh checks the
# HTTP status and the returned id). The closing side had none, so the raw curl
# was the only way to do it -- and a guard that can be bypassed is optional.
#
# Usage:
#   msg-close.sh <id> "<result>"
#   msg-close.sh <id> -            # result on stdin (use redirection, not a pipe)
#
# Exits non-zero, with a reason, if the message did not actually close.
