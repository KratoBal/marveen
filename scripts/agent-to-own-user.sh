#
# Move ONE fleet agent onto its own OS user (`agent-<name>`), the way korall was
# moved on 2026-08-19. Idempotent: every step checks first, so a re-run on an
# already-migrated agent changes nothing and still prints the verification.
#
# What it does, in order:
#   1. checks the OS user exists and is in the `fleet` group (it does NOT create users)
#   2. installs the one sudoers line the router needs: marveen -> that user, tmux only
#   3. writes `runAsUser` into agents/<name>/agent-config.json, then READS IT BACK
#      (a failed write here used to let the restart bring the agent back as the old user)
#   4. hands the agent's directory to that user (owner agent-<name>, group fleet,
#      setgid dirs + default ACLs, so the router keeps write access)
#   5. backs up the agent's .claude.json (a wrong start overwrites it with a blank profile)
#   6. restarts the agent through the dashboard API (keeps its context: --continue)
#   7. verifies: the session lives in the new user's own tmux server, and the pane reads
#
# What it deliberately does NOT do: create the user, touch /home/marveen/.claude,
# widen the sudo rule beyond `/usr/bin/tmux`, or migrate more than one agent per run.
#
# Symlink note: the config dir is full of links into /home/marveen/.claude. We use
# `chown -Rh`, which retargets the LINK and never the file it points at -- otherwise
# this would silently hand the router's own shared config to an agent.

# owner-run operation. Without this check the run would get through the early
# steps and die in the middle of handing over the directory, leaving the agent
# half-migrated -- which is worse than not starting.
