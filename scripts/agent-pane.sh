# agent-pane.sh [--prompts] <agent> | [--prompts] --all
#
# Capture a fleet agent's tmux pane FROM THE RIGHT PLACE, and fail loudly when
# it cannot be captured.
#
# Why this exists (measured 2026-08-20 02:14, night approval round):
# the night procedure ran `tmux capture-pane -p -t agent-$a | grep -c 'Do you
# want to'` as marveen for all four agents. korall had been migrated to its own
# OS user (agents/korall/agent-config.json -> runAsUser) hours earlier, so its
# tmux server belongs to agent-korall, not to marveen. The capture failed, the
# pipeline still printed `0`, and the round read as "no permission prompt
# anywhere" while korall's pane had never been looked at. A zero from a failed
# capture is indistinguishable from a zero from a clean pane -- unless the tool
# refuses to print it. This one exits non-zero instead.
#
# The router already resolves runAsUser (src/web/agent-process.ts,
# agentTmuxTarget); this is the same rule for shell callers, read from the same
# file, so the two cannot drift apart by being written twice.
#
#   bash /home/marveen/marveen/scripts/agent-pane.sh korall            # print the pane
#   bash /home/marveen/marveen/scripts/agent-pane.sh --prompts --all   # per-agent prompt count
#
# --prompts prints one line per agent: `<name>: <n> prompt` or `<name>: UNREACHABLE (reason)`.
# Exit code is 0 only if EVERY agent asked for was actually reached.
