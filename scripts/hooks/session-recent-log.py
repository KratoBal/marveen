"""SessionStart hook: the last few things I did, so a restart does not erase the day.

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured 2026-09-01 22:02. The container was recreated at 21:41 and the
live conversation went with it. Minutes later I asked the owner a question whose answer we
had produced together that same afternoon. His words: *"Tenyleg ki kell erre talalnunk
valamit, hogy tudd mit csinalunk mert ebbol elobb utobb baj lesz."*

The record was never missing: every one of those rounds is in the daily log, written by me,
with a measured timestamp. What was missing is that nothing PUT IT IN FRONT OF ME at the
moment the session began. A log nobody opens is not a memory.

This prints only the HEADLINE of each recent entry (the first line), newest first, and
names the command that opens the full text. The point is recognition, not recall: enough to
know that a subject was already handled, and where to read the rest.

Read-only: it queries the dashboard API and prints. It writes nothing.
