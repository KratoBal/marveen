"""UserPromptSubmit hook: what we ALREADY said about the subject of this message.

WHY THIS EXISTS, measured 2026-09-02 07:36. The owner's words, after a morning in which he
had to remind me twice that something was already decided or already built: *"lehet kozos
kereso, de ez hogy oldja meg azt a problemat, hogy en emlekszem arra mit csinaltunk ti meg
nem? Eddig tulnyomo tobbsegben en figyelmeztettelek arra, hogy valamirol mar beszeltunk,
vagy mar kesz van."*

He is right, and a search tool alone does not fix it: a search I have to remember to run is
the same shape as every rule that was written down and skipped anyway. So this runs on the
INCOMING MESSAGE, before I can answer, and puts the prior rounds in front of me whether or
not it occurred to me to look.

WHAT IT SEARCHES: six stores. Four via /api/recall, in one call per keyword -- memories
(FTS), the daily log, kanban card titles and descriptions, and CARD COMMENTS. The comments
matter most of the four: a card's title is a name, but its comments carry the decision --
what was measured, what the owner said, why a thing was dropped. Then the Discord channel
cache, and SIXTH, the header comments of our own `scripts/*.sh`.

THE SIXTH WAS ADDED 2026-09-21, and its reason is a category the other five cannot cover:
all of them hold TEXT WE WROTE ABOUT WORK, while a CAPABILITY lives in the TOOL. That day
I asked the owner for a permission that `scripts/ticket-mail.sh` had held for three days,
and whose header says so outright. This hook fired on that message, searched five stores
and found nothing relevant -- which reads exactly like "never happened". See
script_headers() for the full measurement.

Card comments were added to /api/recall on 2026-09-02 (db.ts::recallSearch). Before that
this hook made a separate /api/kanban call and could only match titles; that older shape
is gone, and so is the caveat this header used to carry about comments being uncovered.

Keywording: FTS5 joins terms with an implicit AND, and the log match is a plain LIKE, so
handing over a whole sentence reliably returns nothing -- a zero that says more about the
question than about the world. Each keyword is therefore queried on its own, and a hit that
matches several keywords ranks above one that matches a single one.

Read-only and fail-open: any error, any slow API, and it prints nothing. A recall hook that
can block a prompt would be worse than the forgetting it treats.

# WHY THE OUTGOING PATH GOT A BRAKE, AND THE PROMPT PATH DID NOT (measured 2026-09-03 13:44).
#
# The header above says this hook never blocks, and for a PROMPT that is still right: a
# blocked prompt kills the turn. An outgoing message is a different animal. Blocking it
# costs one round and nothing else -- the text is still in my hand, and I either send it
# again or drop the question.
#
# The measurement that forced this: at 13:44 I asked Balazs for a screenshot of the UNAS
# admin orders page. This hook ran on that very message and found memory 1289, which says
# he sent those screenshots on 2026-09-02 15:54 and that I had already written up the full
# inventory. The warning printed. The message went out anyway, because additionalContext
# arrives beside the send, not before it. Seventeen minutes earlier he had written that he
# does not know what to do to make us remember -- and this was the fourth repeat that day.
#
# So the guard was doing exactly what our own rule calls the worst kind: it spoke, and the
# operation went through beside it. A guard is proven by NOTHING HAPPENING, not by a line
# of text.
#
# THE BRAKE IS DELIBERATELY NARROW, on three axes at once:
#   1. outgoing messages only (never a prompt),
#   2. only when the text actually ASKS the human for something -- a report or a decision
#      being handed back does not need re-reading,
#   3. ONE SHOT per text: the same message sent a second time goes through. This is a speed
#      bump, not a wall. If I read the hits and still want to ask, nothing stands in the way.
# Without (3) a false positive would be a wall, and a wall on outgoing messages would be
# worse than the forgetting it treats -- the same argument the header makes for prompts.

# already decided (the long-description field; the separate image store). Both times I searched
# the four stores below, found nothing, and reported "it is nowhere recorded". Both times HE
# found the answer in ONE MINUTE, by scrolling the Discord thread -- and in the second case what
# he found was MY OWN reply saying "felvéve" (recorded), for a recording that never happened.
#
# The four stores are all places where I write things down AFTERWARDS. The channel is where the
# decision is SPOKEN, and it is the only store that does not depend on me remembering to fill it.
# That is exactly why it belongs here and not in a tool I have to remember to run: this hook's
# own header says a search you must remember to run is the same shape as a rule that was written
# down and skipped anyway. The tool (scripts/szal-keres.sh) exists since 12:30 that day, and by
# 13:05 I had already assigned work against a decided question without running it.
