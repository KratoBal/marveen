"""PreToolUse gate: auto-allow read-only shell commands that only fail today
because they contain a shell VARIABLE.

WHY THIS EXISTS (acrobot brief, 2026-09-23, kanban -- barracuda 25 stops).
barracuda's profile runs in strict mode. Claude Code's own permission engine
refuses ANY Bash command that contains a variable expansion ("Contains
simple_expansion"), REGARDLESS of what is on the allow-list, because static
analysis cannot resolve what the variable will hold at run time. barracuda's
real, daily work is exactly this shape: `/bin/grep -vP mintat "$S/a.tsv"`,
where `$S` is a location-scoped scratch path he set earlier in the same
session. The command is genuinely read-only; only the variable trips the
generic engine.

THE FIX THAT WAS REJECTED FIRST, AND WHY: switching the profile to permissive
mode (`--dangerously-skip-permissions`) also bypasses the DENY list
(src/web/profiles.ts says so), and barracuda's deny list blocks store/**
(live Coolify tokens, DB passwords, the Medusa master key) and
.channels-config/** (channel credentials). Permissive mode would open those
too. Rejected.

THE APPROACH HERE: a narrow, additive PreToolUse hook. It looks at ONLY the
Bash tool, and only ever emits an explicit "allow" decision -- never "deny".
Every command it does not confidently recognise as read-only falls straight
through with NO output, which means Claude Code's own engine decides exactly
as it does today (ask, or allow via the profile's own allow-list). A wrong
call by this gate therefore costs one extra confirmation, never a silent
bypass and never a new block.

THREE CONDITIONS, ALL REQUIRED, PER SEGMENT (contract given by acrobot):

  1. Every segment's program is on a narrow read-only allow-list, DERIVED
     AT RUNTIME from templates/profiles/researcher-reader.json's own
     `filesystem.allow` array (see `read_only_binaries_from_profile`) --
     never a hand-typed second copy. `find` and `sed` get an extra,
     command-specific safety check (see below) because their PRESENCE on
     the allow-list does not mean every invocation of them is read-only.
  2. Every ${VAR}/$VAR reference in every argument must be resolvable
     from a SIMPLE "NAME=value" assignment earlier in the SAME command
     block (barracuda's actual shape: `S=/tmp/.../scratch` on its own
     line, then the real command below it -- see
     `_pure_assignment_tokens`/`_resolve_or_flag`). If a variable cannot
     be resolved this way, the WHOLE command fails condition 2 and the
     gate does not intervene (acrobot's explicit rule, 2026-09-23: an
     unresolved variable must fall back to asking, never pass on the
     strength of whatever literal text happens to remain). Once resolved
     (or if the argument never referenced a variable at all), the text is
     checked against a literal deny-listed path fragment (store/,
     .channels-config/, .env, .ssh/, .aws/, .gnupg/), read from the SAME
     profile file's `filesystem.deny` array.
  3. No side effect or hidden execution, WITH ONE NAMED EXCEPTION (see
     below): no `sed -i` / `sed --in-place`, no command substitution
     (`$(...)`, backtick), and every `;`/`&&`/`||`/`|`/newline-joined
     segment must independently satisfy conditions 1 and 2 (a chain to
     something NOT on the list, or to an unresolvable variable, fails the
     whole command).

THE ONE EXCEPTION, ADDED 2026-09-23 (kanban daba735e, acrobot's card
8170112b investigation): output redirection (`>`, `>>`) is no longer an
automatic reject. barracuda's real, daily work writes a read-only
command's output to a scratch file in HIS OWN scratchpad before piping it
onward -- a shape condition 3's original blanket "no redirection" rule
correctly refused, because a redirect target is IN GENERAL a write
anywhere on disk. The narrowed rule: a segment with a trailing `>`/`>>`
still passes condition 3 IF, AND ONLY IF, the redirect target -- resolved
through the exact same same-block variable bindings as every other
argument (never trusted unresolved) -- is an ABSOLUTE path inside
`/tmp/claude-<the calling process's own real uid>` (see
`_own_scratchpad_prefix`). That prefix is not a convention this hook
invents: `/tmp/claude-<uid>` is the actual scratchpad root Claude Code
itself creates per agent, mode 0700, so even a bug in this gate's own
logic would still be caught by the filesystem permission bit -- another
agent's UID cannot write there regardless of what this hook decides. A
redirect to anywhere else (a second unresolved variable, a relative
path, a different agent's scratchpad, store/, anywhere) still fails the
segment exactly as before this change. `sed -i` remains blocked
unconditionally -- this exception is only for plain shell redirection,
never for a flag that rewrites its input file in place.

WHAT THIS STILL DOES NOT AND CANNOT PROVE, STATED PLAINLY: even a
same-block assignment (`S=/tmp/x`) is trusted at face value -- this gate
does not re-derive where that value itself came from, and a value that
is itself unusual (assigned from something outside the visible block) is
exactly the case condition 2 refuses to resolve. What is now closed: a
BARE `"$S/a.tsv"` with NO assignment anywhere in the block no longer
auto-allows on the strength of the literal remainder after stripping --
it now correctly falls through to ask, same as any other unverifiable
input. That is why scope is barracuda only, and why the caller (acrobot)
is asked to sign off on this specific tradeoff before it goes live -- see
the kanban card this ships with.

HOOK CONTRACT (matched against scripts/hooks/outgoing-copy-gate.py, the
PreToolUse example in this repo). CORRECTED 2026-09-23 by nautilus: an
earlier draft of this paragraph also named prior-art-recall.py as a
PreToolUse example -- it is NOT, its own docstring says UserPromptSubmit,
and its output shape is additionalContext, not a permissionDecision. The
two events take different stdin and produce different stdout, so copying
from the wrong one silently produces a hook that never decides anything.
stdin carries {"tool_name": ..., "tool_input": {...}}. To
AUTO-ALLOW, print one line of JSON to stdout:

    {"hookSpecificOutput": {"hookEventName": "PreToolUse",
                             "permissionDecision": "allow",
                             "permissionDecisionReason": "..."}}

and exit 0. To leave the decision to the normal flow (uncertain, risky, or
not a Bash call at all), print NOTHING and exit 0 -- this is deliberately
the same "do nothing" shape as a hook that never ran, so a bug here degrades
to today's behaviour, never to a block and never to a silent bypass.
