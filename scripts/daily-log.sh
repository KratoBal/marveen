# Append a daily-log entry whose timestamp the SCRIPT measures.
#
# Why this exists: the entry header used to be typed by hand into the curl
# body, so the time was whatever the writer believed it to be when composing
# the sentence -- and composing happens before the call runs. Measured
# 2026-08-19: two entries in one morning were off by four and five minutes,
# both drifting forward, both in an append-only log where the only fix is a
# second entry. A rule in a document gets skipped; a script that stamps the
# time itself cannot be.
#
# Usage:
#   daily-log.sh <agent> "<title>" "<body>"
#   daily-log.sh <agent> "<title>" -        # body on stdin (use redirection)
#
# Prints the API response. Exits non-zero if the API did not return ok.

# Budapest is a read-only bind mount from the host and the host file is empty,
# so glibc falls back to UTC while still printing the zone name: `date` answers
# two hours behind Budapest. local-now.sh reads Node's own tz data instead and
# fails loudly rather than returning a wrong hour.
