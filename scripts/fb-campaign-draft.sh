# fb-campaign-draft.sh -- create a PAUSED copy of an existing Facebook campaign.
#
# A DECISION WAS REVERSED TO GET HERE, and it is written down so the second one
# does not later look like the only one. On 2026-08-21 barracuda asked for a
# write path and I refused it (msg 2269): an agent that reads foreign web pages
# all day must not hold a tool that can create objects in a live ad account, and
# one campaign was not worth building a permanent money-spending capability for.
# Balazs then asked for the draft to be uploaded automatically. The refusal still
# stands where it was aimed -- no agent got this tool, and the researcher profiles
# now DENY it by name -- but the tool itself exists, lives in its own file, and is
# run by the orchestrator, which does not read the open web. What changed is who
# holds it, not whether an exposed agent may have it.
#
# WHY THIS IS A SEPARATE FILE: fb-insights.sh is documented and relied upon as
# READ-ONLY ("only GET is ever issued"), and other agents' security profiles were
# written on that promise. Adding a write path there would quietly break a
# property someone else already trusted. This file is the only place in the
# fleet that can create an advertising object, and it is deliberately small.
#
# WHAT IT CAN AND CANNOT DO, and why that is in the tool and not in a prompt:
#
#   * It can ONLY copy an existing campaign. It cannot compose a new one from
#     free-form fields, so it cannot invent targeting, creative or placements.
#     That is also what we want editorially: the whole point of the measurement
#     plan is that this year's campaign matches last year's.
#   * Every copy is created with status_option=PAUSED, and the script then
#     re-asserts PAUSED on the new campaign. There is NO flag to activate
#     anything. Going live is a human action in Ads Manager, always.
#   * The daily budget is capped at DAILY_MAX below. Above it the script exits
#     without calling the API at all -- not a warning, a refusal.
#   * Every write is appended to store/fb-campaign-writes.log with a measured
#     timestamp, so "who created this" is answerable later.
#
# CURRENCY, MEASURED 2026-08-21, do not "fix" this: the account is HUF and the
# Graph API uses WHOLE FORINTS for it (offset 1), not fillers. Proof, two
# independent readings from the live account: the 2025 Webshop campaign reports
# daily_budget "3500" for a budget that was 3 500 Ft, and the account reports
# min_daily_budget 317, which is a plausible floor in forints and absurd in
# fillers. A wrong assumption here is a 100x money bug in either direction.
#
# KNOWN LIMIT, measured 2026-08-21 on the live account: `clone` uses the Graph
# API's deep copy, and deep copy FAILS on our 2025 campaign. The error is not a
# permission: "A kreativ tartalom nem tartalmazhat normal korrekciokat" (code
# 100, subcode 3858504) -- the 2025 creative uses an enhancement field Meta has
# since retired, and the copy refuses to carry it. What worked instead, and what
# the September draft was actually built from:
#   1. shallow copy of the campaign   (deep_copy=false, status_option=PAUSED)
#   2. shallow copy of the ad set     (deep_copy=false, campaign_id=<new>)
#   3. a NEW creative from the same page post (object_story_id), no retired field
#   4. a NEW ad in the copied ad set, status=PAUSED
# Targeting, optimisation and the conversion event therefore come from last
# year unchanged; only the ad wrapper is new, and the post inside it is the same.
#
# A SECOND MEASURED TRAP, and it cost a wrong belief for a few minutes: setting
# start_time/stop_time on the CAMPAIGN returns {"success":true} and changes
# NOTHING. The schedule lives on the AD SET. Worse, once an ad set has started,
# Meta refuses to move its start ("A kezdesi idopontot nem lehet modositani"),
# so a copy made today starts today; only end_time can still be set. For a
# PAUSED campaign that is harmless -- delivery begins when a human activates it
# -- but the plan must say so, because the start date is not ours to choose.
#
# Usage:
#   bash scripts/fb-campaign-draft.sh clone --from <campaign_id> --name "<name>" \
#        --daily-budget <HUF> --days <n> [--start YYYY-MM-DD]
#   bash scripts/fb-campaign-draft.sh verify <campaign_id>
#
# Output: "OK <new_campaign_id>" plus the verification JSON, or "FAIL <reason>".
# The token is NEVER printed, not even on failure.
